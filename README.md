# Project1 - Trip Tracker


A rich itinerary builder webapp that utilizes Google Maps and Yelp to recommended tourist destinations and restaurants for given trip destinations. The app allows the user to input their intended travel destinations along with their respective dates of travel. Once travel destinations and dates have been set, the app utilizes Yelp's API to recommended nearby tourist attractions and restaurants. The user can then browse through the Top 10 restuarants and attractions for each destination provided and add them to their itinerary. When utilized to its fullest extent, this app allows a user to have a minute to minute, fully scheduled itinerary for their planned vacation!
